# Recipe Costs

Professional kitchens need to know their recipe costs to profitably price their food. Recipe Costs makes it easy to determine both the full cost and cost per serving of each recipe.

This repository houses the JavaScript frontend that interacts with the [Rails API](https://github.com/aparkening/recipe_costs_api).

**App Features**
- Recipe cost is automatically calculated once ingredients are added. If servings are entered, cost per serving is also calculated.
- Ingredient conversions are automatic. Recipe amounts entered as cups will seamlessly take advantage of costs entered as liters or gallons, for example.
- App-wide ingredients provide fast recipe creation. Users can create, modify, and delete ingredients.
- Recipes can be easily created, modified, and deleted.
- Search bar makes it simple to find recipes by name.

## Installation
